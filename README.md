ðŸ“œ Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder


Overview:

This repository contains a Python script that implements the Caesar Cipher for encoding and decoding messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Uploaded on 2024-07-15.


âœ¨ Features:

ðŸ”’ Encoding: Encrypts a message by shifting each letter by a user-defined number of positions.
ðŸ”“ Decoding: Decrypts a message by reversing the shift applied during encryption.
ðŸŽ¯ User Input: Accepts user input for the message and the shift value.


ðŸš€ Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/waqi786/Caesar-Cipher-Encoder-Decoder.git

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using Python 3.x.

4. Follow the prompts to enter the direction (encode or decode), the message, and the shift number.



ðŸ’¡ Example:

Running the script:

For encoding:

1. Type: 'encode' to encrypt, and type: 'decode' to decrypt: encode
2. Enter a message here: hello
3. Enter a shift number: 3
4. The encoded text is khoor
   
For decoding:

1. Type: 'encode' to encrypt, and type: 'decode' to decrypt: decode
2. Enter a message here: khoor
3. Enter a shift number: 3
4. The decoded text is hello

   
ðŸ“‹ Requirements:

Python 3.x
